# Unicorn Company: Data Exploration & Insights
## Project Background
The e-commerce platform Unicorn enables people to purchase products online — from books, toys, clothing, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household goods.
Given that the online sector has gradually gained market share over the past two decades — a trend that is expected to continue due to changing consumer needs and shopping habits — growth is anticipated for the company Unicorn. Despite favorable conditions for the industry, Unicorn's sales data needs to be closely analyzed and evaluated in order to strategically increase profitability across all states.
## Goal 
To perform in-depth data exploration using Google Spreadsheet, SQL and build a dashboard with Tableau to provide insights and business recommendations for the E-Commerce company Unicorn.
## Used Tools (Google Spreadsheets, PostgreSQL, Tableau)
## Part 1: Analysis with Google Sheets
Used pivot tables, created calculated columns (e.g., price per unit), and highlighted underperforming regions using conditional formatting.
## Part 2: Data Exploration with SQL
Explored the Unicorn database using SQL to answer critical questions about sales, profit, and customer behavior.
Cleaned and joined tables, performed aggregations, and ranked cities, products, and regions by their performance.
## Part 3: Insights & Dashboard with Tableau
Created a Tableau dashboard to present key insights, trends, and actionable recommendations for business decision-making.
