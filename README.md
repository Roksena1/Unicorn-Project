# Unicorn Company: Data Exploration & Insights
## Project Background
The e-commerce platform Unicorn enables people to purchase products online — from books, toys, clothing, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household goods.
Given that the online sector has gradually gained market share over the past two decades — a trend that is expected to continue due to changing consumer needs and shopping habits — growth is anticipated for the company Unicorn. Despite favorable conditions for the industry, Unicorn's sales data needs to be closely analyzed and evaluated in order to strategically increase profitability across all states.
## Goal 
To perform in-depth data exploration using Google Spreadsheet, SQL and build a dashboard with Tableau to provide insights and business recommendations for the E-Commerce company Unicorn.
